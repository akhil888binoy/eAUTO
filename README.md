# eAUTO
Software Robot that controls the Email  traffic. This robot automatically downloads a copy of all emails and attachments in your gmail inbox sent from those emails. The robot saves them into separate folders per email address and automatically sends an output report email to the robot developer displaying all logs of what emails have been saved and what errors have occurred.
This will help the user to filter out the important email among the spam emails. The main motive is to save the time of users that they invest to surf through their mail inbox
